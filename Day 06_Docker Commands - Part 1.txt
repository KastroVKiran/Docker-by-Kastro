# Once after you stop the instance and restart the same instance, docker will not work automatically.

# To start the docker 
$ sudo service docker start

# To see the status of the docker
$ sudo service docker status
#In green colour you can see "Status (running)"

# To see the version of the docker
$ docker -v		-----> It will just show the docker version
$ docker version	-----> It will show the complete details of the docker version
$ docker info

# Whenever we want to create a container, we need docker image. By default, we will not have any docker images. Docker images will be available in docker hub/registry.

# To see the list of docker images
$ docker images

The backend process of getting the images:
When we dont see any images, it meants docker client is not having any images. Now, docker client will search with docker host i.e docker daemon/engine. If daemon is having the images, it will display the images. If daemon is not having the images, then it will communicate with the docker hub/registry.

# To search for a specific image
$ docker search <ImageName>
Ex: docker search amazonlinux

# To pull/download the image
$ docker pull <ImageName>
Ex: docker pull amazonlinux

# To see the list of docker images
$ docker images
#You will see the details of the image such as Image ID and Size.

# To create and run the container
$ docker run -it <ContainerName> <ImageName>
Ex: docker run -it container001 amazonlinux

# Once after executing the above command, you will see "bash-5.2#". It means you are currently inside the container.

# To install a software inside the container
$ yum install git

# To verify whether git is installed inside the container or not
$ git --version

# To create a file inside the container
$ touch <FileName>

# To see the list of running containers
$ docker ps

# To stop a container
$ docker stop <ContainerName>

# To see list of both running and not running (stopped) containers
$ docker ps -a

# To restart the container
$ docker start <ContainerName>

# To kill a container
$ docker kill <ContainerName>

#Difference between the 'stop' and 'kill' of a container
=> 'docker stop' will stop all the services inside the container. This is why we have a wait time when we execute 'docker stop'

=> 'docker kill' will directly terminate the container. It will not wait till the containers are stopped. It will kill immediately.
